# anslagstavlan
Also famously known as Datasektionen.se 2.0

Anslagstavlan makes it super-easy to stream the bulletin board in META directly to our website.
On the 1st of April 2015 this was launched as Datasektionen's new website. However, when IOR 
noticed the general disappointment in the crowd, it was quickly trashed under the cunning 
excuse of being an elaborate April's fools joke.
